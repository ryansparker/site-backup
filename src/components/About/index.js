                    <p>Front-end developer with a background in art, design, and education.
                    Many of my skills as a <a href="http://www.ryan-parker.com" id="art" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">printmaking artist</a> and textile designer transfer into my work in coding: craftsmanship, organization,
                    experimentation, and collaboration. Iâ€™m looking for a role as a web developer at a company where I can
                    learn, grow, and continue to master the craft.
